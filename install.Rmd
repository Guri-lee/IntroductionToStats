Please go through the following steps to ensure that you have the correct software installed on your laptop. Threee pieces of software are required.

`R` is our recommended language for statistical analysis and `RStudio` is the GUI that we recommend for working with `R`. However, `RStudio` requires the user to work at the command-line, which is beyond the scope of the course and distracts from the statistical concepts we are trying to teach. Therefore, we use another software package, `R commander`, to run within RStudio and provide point and click access to statistical tests.

#Windows PC

Once loaded, type the following in the 'Console' in the bottom-left where the 'blinking' cursor is; 

```{r echo=FALSE}
options(repos = "http://mirrors.ebi.ac.uk/CRAN/")
```


```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("Rcmdr")
```

4. You should now be able to load 'R commander' by typing the following

```{r eval=FALSE}
