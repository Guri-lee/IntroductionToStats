# Description: 
This course provides a refresher on the foundations of statistical analysis. The emphasis is on interpreting the results of  a statistical test, and being able to determine the correct test to apply. Practicals are conducted using a series of online apps 

# Aims:During this course you will learn about:

- Different types of data, distributions and structure within data
- Summary statistics for continuous and discrete data
- Formulating a null hypothesis
- Assumptions of one-sample and two-sample t-tests
- Interpreting the result of a statistical test
- Statistical tests of categorical variables
- Non-parmetric versions of one- and two-sample tests

# Objectives: After this course you should be able to:

- State the assumptions required for a one-sample and two-sample t-test and be able to interpret the results of such a test
- Know when to apply a paired or independent two-sample t-test
- Assess the distribution of your data and decide if a parametric or non-parametric test is required
- To perform simple statistical calculations using the online app
- Understand the limitations of the tests taught within the course
- Know when more complex statistical methods are required
