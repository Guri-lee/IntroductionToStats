- Interpreting the result of a statistical test
- Statistical tests of categorical variables
- Non-parmetric versions of one- and two-sample tests

# Objectives: After this course you should be able to:

- State the assumptions required for a one-sample and two-sample t-test and be able to interpret the results of such a test
- Know when to apply a paired or independent two-sample t-test
- Assess the distribution of your data and decide if a parametric or non-parametric test is required
